# admin-dashboard

Completed 28/08/2024

I very much enjoyed this project. The reason that this project in particular was provided to the TOP learners was to practise using the Grid layout, having previously only learned how to use Flex.

While Flex clearly has it's benefits, I really enjoyed learning how to use Grid as it's suits my design style and layout logic much better. Obviously, I can't solely use Grid in the future, but I think I will end up mainly relying on this for layouts.

The brief was to make an admin dashboard-style layout similar to this one, with a bit of design leeway: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png

As I've mentioned elsewhere, CSS and design are probably my weakest areas, relatively speaking, so I am very happy with how this looks. Although it took me a long time, mainly due to the sheer number of divs on there - 117 of them!!! - I found it quite easy to lay the page out and manipulate it so that it looked how I wanted it. I like the colour palette that I found and feel that I used some nice-looking text.

As an aside, I discovered the alternative to Lorem Ipsum that I have used here - Hipster Ipsum. It's hilarious!
